CS362 HW3 Python Instructions

To run this program type the following command into the console:

python3 Alex_Vogt_hw3.py




How program works:

This program follows the same logic as the flowchart provided. If the leapYear value equals 1 it is a leap year and if it's equal to 0 then it's not a leap year. 

There is also added error handling that checks if the number is more than zero.
